        <p><u>You cannot miss this!</u></p> 
        <p>The Castle of Horror, in the location of Bran Castle, has been one of the best experiences I’ve ever had in terms of an interactive experience. The atmosphere feels spooky from the moment you step in, and it gets progressively “worse” (truly better for my horror genre enjoyers), from Dracula popping from the ceiling to being followed on the stairs by vampires. I had truly the experience of my life. A downside would be that my pup, Robi, a 3kg Bichon was a bit scared of the whole setting, but he was the best companion. Overall, the price of 40 roni (7,5 euros) was worth it. Highly recommend checking it out!</p>

			<h5>Trusalova Camping: B E A U T I F U L</h5>

        <p>For the past week I’ve been staying at Camping Trusalova, in the region of Turiec, Slovakia, and I’m for sure going to stay a month more. To say that I am obsessed is an understatement. This region of Slovakia truly brings out what was mother earth has best to offer. The camping itself is spacious, well equipped with modern, and clean bathrooms, but it also has little cabins for those who would like to take some nights away from the bed of your campervan. I will give it a 9 out of 10, highly recommend if you want to stop somewhere in Slovakia.</p>

        <p>Vakantiepark Het Lierderholt was a pit stop for me. A few days ago, tiredness got to me and I decided to end my day there, and I really liked it. I saw that it had good reviews on the web, but I don’t trust them, as we know that some businesses pay for them.  The feature of a pool was just what I needed, and I took my sweet time enjoying it. I also enjoyed the laundry service, and the mini market. Overall, I would stop there again. </p>

        <p>My name is Jaan. I am new to camper vanning. At the begging of this year, I was inspired to pursue this lifestyle as I was starting to see more and more people on my socials. I'm currently working remotely as a social media manager for a clothing brand. I've recently moved to the Netherlands and I never realized the variety of nature in Europe. I took this picture in Albania of all places! You'd think you have to travel to Asia for views like these. This place was recommended to me by one of the friends I made on this website. I want to give something back so keep an eye on my blogs where I'm going to share the gems I come to discover on my travels.</p>

        <p>I visited Camping Route Roemenie a while ago and I can assure you this was a great experience! I was anxious at first, as I am still quite new to this way of traveling, but when I arrived I was relieved and so happy I made this decision. Also, I want to point out that this platform helped me tremendously, because this gave me more confidence to travel in the van by myself, and not just in the Netherlands. </p>

		<p>So happy with my trip!!!! Yesterday I visited one of the recommended places, Camping Bela Nizne Kamence, the hype is for real. It was an amazing experience and I saw the beautiful nature that Slovakia has to offer. Wouldn’t have wanted to miss this for the world, highly recommend visiting Little Fatra region.</p>
